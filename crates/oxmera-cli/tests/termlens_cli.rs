//! `termlens-cli` — the command that ships beside the harness this crate
//! already tests with.
//!
//! The rest of the suite asks whether `oxmera` draws the right thing. This
//! asks what a maintainer does *after* it draws the wrong thing, at a shell
//! prompt, with no test to edit: point `termlens inspect` at the binary,
//! and read the committed goldens with `termlens diff` and `termlens
//! render`.
//!
//! Two things make that worth a test here rather than upstream.
//!
//! 1. **The goldens are the CLI's input format.** `tests/golden/*.txt` are
//!    written by `Screen::to_string()` through this crate's `normalize`,
//!    committed, and compared as strings. Nothing checked that they are
//!    still *saved screens* — so `termlens render --svg
//!    tests/golden/tui-replay-100x45.txt`, the way a frame gets into a bug
//!    report, could have quietly stopped working.
//! 2. **The two paths must agree.** `inspect` drives the real `oxmera`
//!    through its own PTY, with its own defaults. If its picture and the
//!    golden `cargo test` compares against ever differ, one of the two is
//!    lying about what the program draws.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d by default: these need `termlens-cli` on the machine, and a
//! `cargo test` that quietly `cargo install`s something is a surprise no
//! published crate should spring on a contributor — `oxmera-cli` is on
//! crates.io, and AGENTS.md requires a fresh clone to build and test with
//! nothing exotic. `stress.yml` runs them by name.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p oxmera-cli --test termlens_cli -- --ignored
//! ```
